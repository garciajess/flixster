### Notes
This update includes similar movies to the recently released movies in the form of a Collection View. When working with the tab bar controller for multiple table views, the story board entry point was in the Now Playing Scence instead of the Tab Bar Controller Scence. This caused the program to maintain a black screen after the launchscreen. After moving the entry point, the app was able to run successfully and display all of the data properly.

### Notes
One challenge I encounted while building the app was modifying the synopsis label so that multiple lines were diaplayed for each movie instead of only one line. I tried expanding the label's size, but after doing some research I realized I had to switch the "Lines" in the Attributes inspector to 0. This fixed the issue I was having and allowed for the synposis to be displayed in multiple lines. After this assignment, I feel more comfortable with creating custom cells and creating a network request to get data returned from the API.
