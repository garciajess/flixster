### Notes
One challenge I encounted while building the app was modifying the synopsis label so that multiple lines were diaplayed for each movie instead of only one line. I tried expanding the label's size, but after doing some research I realized I had to switch the "Lines" in the Attributes inspector to 0. This fixed the issue I was having and allowed for the synposis to be displayed in multiple lines. After this assignment, I feel more comfortable with creating custom cells and creating a network request to get data returned from the API.
